# Simple Testerra Skeleton

This project is a simple skeleton project for Testerra framework addressing basic features,  
file and directory structure and common best practices to getting you and your project work as fast as possible.  
For simplicity, we will use Maven as build and dependency management tool. 

## Demo App
For sample page objects and easy testcases we use https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ as base url for testing.

## What you get

### Page object and GuiElement
You will see how to use Testerra `Page` objects and work with basic features and selectors of `GuiElement`. 

### Properties
This project shows how you can set up a basic `test.properties` file to get things started locally.

### TestNG execution
With a simple Maven profile called `mySuite` you can run all tests from `TheInternetTest` class with 3 parallel browser sessions. 
You get in touch how to configure a TestNG suite file.

### Localization
To get in touch with localization, this skeleton project provides a simple resource bundle for english language.
The usage can be seen in some `Page` object classes of this project.
